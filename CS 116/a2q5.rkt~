Complete the function select-min which consumes a function f and three lists A,B,C, all of the same length and containing the same type of values. The function f consumes a single value of the same type as the list elements, and produces a number. Consider the values a,b,c, where a is from A, b is from B, c is from C, all located at the same location in their respective lists. The list produced by select- min will include
•	aif(f a)is less or equal to both(f b)and(f c), •	bif(f b)is less than(f a)and less or equal to(f c), • cotherwise,
for each such triple.
For example,
(select-min string-length (list "hi" "there" "friend" "a-z")
(list "two"	"times"	"three"
(list "about" "nothing" "" => (list "hi"	"there"	""
"123") "!!!")) "a-z")
For this question, you may use structural recursion (though it can be completed using abstract list functions).
