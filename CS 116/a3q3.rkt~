;; Question 3:

;; A bar is a (listof note) [Non-Empty]

;; A key of note can be represented as a pair of integers (a,b) where:

;; a is the number of the octave between [0..8]
;; b is the sequence number within an octave between [1..12]

;; find the highest
;;find the lowest
;; filter all others
;; find the range b.w them

;;prod bar, range

(define (largest-range bars)
  (local
    [
     
     (define (range note1 note2)
       (cond
         [(equal? (min (first note1) (first note2))
                  (first note1))
          (+ (* (- (first note2) (first note1)) 12)
          (second note1) (second note2)))]))
