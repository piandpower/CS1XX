               ; write down meanings of errors cuz the are diff & vague : /
 ;; number * string / string * number = number # of strings.
;; print: displays variable values-- doesnt produces anything- just display
 
raw-input always produces a string -- even if a string OF a number

 ;; print string-> print w.o quotation.
 
 ;; diff- deals with whats happening now- then later as opposed to how
 ;; evaluated to get to a result.
 ;; empty string is string w/ no characters
 
 
 ;; case sensitive.
