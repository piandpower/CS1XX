;;Consumes P which represents the principal sum on the account
;;on which interest is compounded and years, which is the
;;remaining number of years that the closing balance will be 
;;evaluated for and produces the balance on the account after
;;withdrawals for the year.
;;Examples: 
;;(compounded-P P 0)=> 1000000
;;(compounded-P P 2)=> 958400
;;(compounded-P P 21)=> -8458.43
