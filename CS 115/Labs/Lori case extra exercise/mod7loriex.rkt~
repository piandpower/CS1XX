(define-struct word-pair (str-one str-two))
;; A word-pair is a structure (make-word-pair s1 s2), 
;; where s1 and s2 are non-empty strings, and
;; the last letter in s1 is the same as the first letter
;; in s2.

;; build-word-pairs: (listof string) (listof string)
;;                   -> (listof word-pair)
;; produces a list of word pairs from one-source
;; and two-source, but finds the first entry in 
;; two-source which matches each entry in one-source.
;; Once a match for a word in one-source is found,
;; continue the search for the next word in one-source
;; from that point in two-source.
;; Note that not all words in one-source will have appear
;; as part of a word-pair in the produced value.
;; example: (build-word-pairs (list "abc" "def" "ghijkl")
;;   (list "horse" "cat" "goose" "gander" "frog"))
;; => (list (make-word-pair "abc" "cat")
;;          (make-word-pair "def" "frog"))
